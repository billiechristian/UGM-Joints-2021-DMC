# UGM-Joints-2021-DMC

On March 2021, my team (https://www.linkedin.com/in/msammyivank/ and https://www.linkedin.com/in/imavv/) participated in a data mining competition for the 2nd time that was held by UGM. For the preliminary round, we were assigned to solve a kind of customer churn problem. We were to solve whether an old customer in an insurance company choose to continue buying the insurance or not using machine learning. We successfully predict the binary classification task by utilizing ensemble voting from some models such as XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, etc. and achieved 0.9 mean F1 score, placing us on the 2nd place at Kaggle Leaderboard.

For the final round we were given a multiple classification dataset with 3 labels. The task was to predict the correct type of taxi customers for each unique taxi trip. By utilizing XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, and Extra Trees models and ensembling them, we achieved model accuracy of 0.71. Through presenting our final work we achieved 3rd place at this data mining competition.
